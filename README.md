Overview
The Urban Residential Properties Web Application is a full-stack platform designed to help users search for, view, and get AI-driven recommendations for residential properties in urban areas. The app features a user authentication system, property listings with detailed information, and personalized property recommendations powered by AI.

TECHNOLOGY STACK:

Frontend:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core technologies for building the structure, design, and interactivity of the application.
React.js: JavaScript library for building interactive UI components and managing the state of the application.
Bootstrap: Framework for responsive design to ensure the application looks great on all screen sizes.
Axios: For making API requests to the backend.

Backend:
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
Express.js: Framework for building APIs and handling server requests.
MySQL: SQL database to store user data, property listings, and other relevant information.

AI/ML Features
Python: Used for implementing AI-based features and models.
Scikit-learn: Library for building machine learning models for property recommendation.
Pandas, Numpy: For data manipulation and processing in the recommendation system.
Flask: Python web framework for serving the recommendation model as an API to the frontend.

PROJECT ARCHITECTURE:

The application follows a client-server architecture:

Frontend (Client-Side):

Built with React.js and communicates with the backend via RESTful API requests using Axios.
The frontend is responsible for rendering UI elements, handling user interactions, and displaying data retrieved from the backend.
Includes components for the login system, property listings, search filters, and AI-driven property recommendations.
Backend (Server-Side):

A Node.js server powered by Express.js handles API requests from the frontend.
Authenticates users via JWT and provides endpoints for property data, search functionality, and AI recommendations.
Stores data such as user accounts and property listings in a MongoDB database.
Sends responses to the frontend to update the UI with relevant data.
AI Model (Machine Learning):

The recommendation engine uses Python (Scikit-learn) to suggest personalized properties based on user preferences.
The model is trained using data such as location preferences, budget, and user activity.
The AI model is served via a Flask API, which communicates with the backend server to provide recommendations to the frontend.
AI Features Implemented
AI-Driven Property Recommendations:

Based on the userâ€™s preferences (such as location, budget, and desired amenities), the application recommends properties using an AI model.
The recommendation engine is trained on historical data, including user interactions and property features, to generate personalized suggestions.
The AI model uses collaborative filtering or content-based filtering techniques to make predictions.
User Behavior Analysis:

The AI system tracks user preferences and interactions with different property listings to continuously improve recommendations over time.
This helps tailor the user experience, making it more relevant as users browse and search for properties.
